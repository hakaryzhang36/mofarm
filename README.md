# Mofarm

A modular machine learning platform, used in my tutor's lab.
(my undergraduate graduation project)

This platform tranfers ML model into different general modules. You can generate your own ML model with visual tool.


## Environment

- python 3.6.9
- django 3.0.5

## Install
    git clone https://git.so-link.org/zhanghaijia/Undergraduate-Graduation-Project.git

## Install Requirements

Run the commond below in `./MoFarm_haijia` and `./MoFarm_slave_haijia` respectively.

    pip install -r requirements.txt 

## Usage

This project is a distributate system. To start project, you need to start a main server and a slave server at least.
### Quick Start

#### 1 Start Main Server

Run command below in `./MoFarm_haijia` .

    python3 manage.py runserver on 0.0.0.0:9000

*Note: This port is default. If you need to run main server on customized port, you should check [Coustomize Setting](#customize-setting) for more.*

#### 2 Start Slave Server

Run command below in `./MoFarm_slave_haijia` .

    python3 manage.py runserver on 0.0.0.0:12345

*Note: This address is default. If you need to run slave server on customized address, you should check [Coustomize Setting](#customize-setting) for more.*

#### 3 Open Web Page

Run `./page/index.html` .

### Customize Setting

- Set Main Server's Address

    Before slave server start, the main server's address should be set correctly.

    Modify and save `./MoFarm_slave_haijia/MoFarmBackEnd/slave_config.py` to set main server's address.

        CONTROLLER_IP = '0.0.0.0'
        CONTROLLER_PORT = '9000'

- Set Slave Server's Address
    
    This platform supports add slave servers in real time. Before start a new slave server, you should make sure your [start command](#2-start-slave-server) is consistent with slave server's config.

    Modify and save `./MoFarm_slave_haijia/MoFarmBackEnd/slave_config.py` to set slave server's address.

        SLAVE_IP = '0.0.0.0'                     
        SLAVE_PROT = '12345'
